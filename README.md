# OG-MYS
OG-MYS is an overlapping-generations (OG) model that allows for dynamic general equilibrium analysis of fiscal policy for Malaysia. OG-MYS is built on the [OG-Core](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) framework. The model output includes changes in macroeconomic aggregates (GDP, investment, consumption), wages, interest rates, and the stream of tax revenues over time. Regularly updated documentation of the model theory--its output, and solution method. Documentation of the Python API and Malaysia-specific calibration of the model will be available soon.
